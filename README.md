# Deep-Learning-Plagizalok

**Team:** Plagizálók<br>
**Members:** Ragács Attila, Urbanics András, Pfeifer Dániel

**Goal:** Solving the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification">Spooky Author Identification excercise on Kaggle</a>, identifying the author of English sentences and deciding between Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, or HP Lovecraft.

**Methods:** Simple statistical methods, and Neural Networks: Dense, CNN, Hyperparameter-optimization.

**Files:**

For the reproduction of the Dense Neural Network run the dense_neural_network.ipynb notebook, it uses the file train.csv and author_identification_dense_model.h5 in the end. Also the FastText wordembeddings can be downloaded with the code included in the notebook (it is commented out originally).
